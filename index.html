                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
                Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
                Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace
                engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
                was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[2]
                He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                missile and launch vehicle technology.[3][4][5] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
                India in 1974.[6]

                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President",[7] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.

                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[8] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
                honours.[9]
